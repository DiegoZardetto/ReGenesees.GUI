Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 2.0

 - The main purpose of this version is to ensure a safe transition of package
   ReGenesees.GUI to the "R 4.x" series. Indeed R 4.0.0. brought in some
   potentially disruptive changes: see, e.g., the following NOTEs.
 - NOTE: Under R 4.0.0 or later, old versions of the ReGenesees.GUI package need
   to be re-installed from sources (i.e. local .tar.gz files). Binary
   distributions of old versions (i.e. local .zip files) are expect not to work
   under R 4.0.0 or later.
 - NOTE: R 4.0.0 changed the default value of argument 'stringsAsFactors', which
   enters functions data.frame(), as.data.frame(), read.table() and possibly
   many others. The new default is now: *stringsAsFactors = FALSE*.
 - As most ReGenesees functions *require* categorical variables be represented
   as *factors*, ReGenesees.GUI 'Import Datasets' facilities now use explicitly:
   stringsAsFactors = TRUE. This is expected to leave the behavior of
   ReGenesees.GUI unchanged when switching to R 4.x.
 - The GUI gained a new "Website" menu, which browses the brand new ReGenesees
   website hosted on GITHUB pages: https://diegozardetto.github.io/ReGenesees
 - Package ReGenesees.GUI is now also available from GITHUB at the URL below:
   https://github.com/DiegoZardetto/ReGenesees.GUI
 - Conflicting imports of function `?` from packages utils and svMisc have been
   ruled out from the NAMESPACE file (in favor of utils::?): this complies with
   recent tighter 'R CMD check' rules on declaring dependencies.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.9

 - This is a wrap-up release, whose main purpose is to ensure a safe transition
   to the "R 3.4.x" series.
 - In R 3.4.0, which now includes Tcl/Tk 8.6.4, it is forbidden to mix 'tkpack'
   and 'tkgrid' geometry managers on the same widgets/slaves. This caused
   troubles to ReGenesees.GUI. Fixed, by dismissing 'tkpack' in favor of
   'tkgrid' (with some boring struggle to keep the whole look & feel of the
   GUI unchanged).
 - New dialog window "Trim Calibration Weights" in the "Calibration" menu:
   allows to trim calibration weights consistently, i.e. preserving all the
   calibration constraints (via function trimcal of package ReGenesees).
 - Better labels for dialog window "Merge New Data into a Survey Design".


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.8.1

 - This is a patched version, whose main purpose is to ensure a safe transition
   to the "R 3.3.x" series.
 - No user-visible changes.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.8

 - New dialog window "Describe a Population Totals Template" in the
   "Calibration" menu: allows to print on screen a natural language description
   of the structure of a known totals data frame (via function pop.desc of
   package ReGenesees).
 - New dialog window "Shares" in the "Estimates and Errors" menu: allows to
   compute estimates and errors for the shares of a numeric variable held by
   specific population groups, possibly within domains (via function svystatS of
   package ReGenesees).
 - New dialog window "Share Ratios" in the "Estimates and Errors" menu: allows
   to compute estimates and errors for ratios between shares of a numeric
   variable held by specific population groups, possibly within domains (via
   function svystatSR of package ReGenesees).
 - All the commands inserted and stored into the "Commands Window" are now
 also* flushed to the *R history file* just upon execution.
   NOTE: Currently, this has been deliberately limited to Windows, as OSs of the
   Linux/Unix family and Mac have different mechanisms to handle R history,
   which I'm not willing to dig into at the moment.
 - Dialog window "Environment Options": fixed a small and harmless bug causing
   the 'scipen' slider to freeze after 'scipen' was set to a negative value.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.7

 - To date, ReGenesees GVF infrastructure can be used only through the command
   line. To be honest, I am not sure the GUI will ever support GVF functions.
 - GUI function "Build a Template for Population Totals" failed after R 3.2.0
   when trying to visualize output, due to a new-born bug in internal function
   editRG. Fixed.
 - The tcltk widget triggered by "Show Datasets" happened to be visualized badly
   for data frames with many columns *and* long column names (let's say when
   data is such that sum(nchar(names(data))) > 3000). This behavior was most
   likely seen for huge population totals templates and data frames. Fixed.
 - GUI function "Build a Template for Population Totals" visualized generated
   templates twice if they were big: the first time in "edit" mode (i.e. cells
   could be filled/changed by the user), the second in "visualization" mode.
   Now the second static visualization is only triggered if cells have been
   actually edited manually during the first visualization (which, by the way,
   is rather unlikely to happen for big templates...).


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.6

 - GUI functionalities for the GVF infrastructure provided by package ReGenesees
   are currently in an early design stage.
 - On some 64 bit Windows 7 machines (under default settings) text fields which
   had by default a white background color in Windows XP were visualized with an
   ugly non-white background: this has been fixed.
 - Font color of warning messages has been changed for better readability (from
   'olivedrab4' to 'forestgreen').
 - Under Windows 7, Dataset Import/Export windows happen to invert the display
   order of file extensions when switching from 32 to 64 bit builds of R (e.g.
   when importing from Text Files the first reported option is 'All files (*,*)'
   rather than e.g. '*.txt'). The setting resulting in the right ordering
   under 64 bit R has been chosen (sorry for 32 bit users).


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.5

 - New dialog window "Merge New Data into a Survey Design" in the "Survey
   Design" menu: allows to join new survey data to the original ones stored
   inside a design object via function des.merge of package ReGenesees.
 - New "font size" slider in "Environment Options" dialog. Allows to change the
   size of the fonts used in many (yet not all) the text fields of the GUI. The
   change is immediately active upon setting, without the need of restarting the
   GUI. While setting a big size (say > 10 points) can improve the readability
   of some items, it can make the overall look of the GUI less pretty.
 - New entry "ReGenesees Flyer" in the "Help" menu: allows to visualize a short
   document providing a description of the ReGenesees system (the pdf file can 
   be found inside the \doc folder of the installation directory of the
   ReGenesees package).
 - New checkbox entry in "Variance Estimation Options" dialog: allows to switch
   on/off the warnings raised when a domain intersects just a single PSU in a
   stratum (see ?ReGenesees.options).
 - The ReGenesees GUI facility now has its own icon: the "RG" string typed in
   red Newton font. This icon will replace the TK default icon in all the
   top-level windows generated by interacting with the GUI. The default TK icon
   will be silently restored when closing the GUI.
 - The behaviour of pop-up boxes storing error messages has been entirely
   re-worked out. Now error boxes are strictly modal and must be destroyed
   before interacting again with the window (i.e. function) which triggered the
   error. This is more robust against unhandled Tk errors possibly caused by a
   child window being destroyed after its parent window.
 - ReGenesees.GUI: now checks that the screen resolution is enough to work
   correctly (i.e. 1024x768 at least), otherwise raises an error. This may rule
   out some netbooks.
 - GUI intro image has been slightly resized (to comply with the ongoing pc
   screens' tendency toward rectangular aspect ratios).
 - GUI intro and main windows are now aligned with their top-right corner placed
   at screen's top-right corner (formerly they were bottom-right aligned).
 - Better vertical spacing of "Output Object Name" entry in all windows.
 - Cross-platform management of monospaced fonts (e.g. Courier) is now more
   robust.
 - Dialogs triggering functions pop.template, aux.estimates and (depending on
   the nature of the input) e.calibrate generated "non standard" spacing of 
   printed statements at the "Commands Window": fixed.
 - Statement printed at the "Commands Window" by the dialog window of function
   des.addvars was "non standard" (though not incorrect) as it lacked its first
   formal argument: fixed.
 - ReGenesees.GUI: implemented a trick to keep assigning objects into the
   .GlobalEnv without making 'R CMD check' angry.
 - Packages on which ReGenesees.GUI used to depend are now explicitly listed in
   the import directive of the NAMESPACE file: this complies with tighter 'R CMD
   check' rules on declaring dependencies.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.4

 - This is essentially a maintenance release, with few user-visible changes.
   The major goal was to verify that the transition of ReGenesees.GUI to the
   "R 3.x" realm would have been safe. To date, everything seems to be ok.
 - Set bigger font size for "Variance Estimation Options" dialog.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.3

 - First release with ByteCompile build: unless something unexpected is
   signalled, this will be the standard from now on.
 - New dialog window "Regression Coefficients" in "Estimates and Errors" menu:
   enables estimation of multiple regression coefficients via function svystatB
   of package ReGenesees.
 - Copy (and, when appropriate, paste) pop-up menus (displayed upon mouse
   right-click) have been enabled for all text widgets (Commands and Warnings
   Windows + those in functions des.addvars, svystatB, svystatL, e.calibrate,
   pop.template, fill.template, aux.estimates).
 - Text widgets for des.addvars, svystatB and svystatL now allow to insert
   where the user places the cursor (formerly, insertion automatically took
   place at the end of the current text), and keep the focus after insertion.
 - A bug caused the "collapse" button (with label "+...+") to loose the first
   (and only the first) variable appearing in the variables listbox whenever
   such variable was selected. Fixed.
 - All dialog windows provided with a help button in the bottom-right corner
   now have a new tooltip. When the cursor is on the help button, the tooltip
   shows the title of the corresponding function.
 - ReGenesees.GUI main window now has a tooltip explaining "ReGenesees" acronym:
   it is shown when the cursor is placed on the "ReGenesees" icon.
 - Better font and text alignment for "Variance Estimation Options" dialog
   window.
 - All .GIF icons appearing inside ReGenesees.GUI widgets have been renewed.
   I believe the overall effect is very satisfying.
 - Extensive tests performed on Windows 7: all GUI pieces work fine and the GUI
   looks very good.
 - Tests performed on Mac OS: the GUI works without any bug, but its overall
   look is definitely worse than under Windows. Despite I find this situation
   quite bothering, I actually have no time to try to mitigate it (the problem
   seems to be caused by the simultaneous usage of tcltk and tcltk2 widgets).
 - Sometimes (only sometimes, weird but true) the main window of the GUI
   happened to be slightly misplaced at startup. Fixed: now bottom-right corner
   is always correctly placed at screen's bottom-right corner.
 - Though in very rare cases (say 1%), the "ReGenesees" icon in GUI main window
   happened to be "flashing": adding a small system delay to the packing of the
   widget seems to have fixed such problem.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.2

 - A typo in internal code of svystatR widget caused the default conf.lev to be 
   0 instead of 0.95. Fixed.
 - New dialog window in "Calibration Models Options" in "Calibration" menu:
   allows to enable or switch off contrasts. This global option affects the
   behaviour of several ReGenesees functions, e.g. e.calibrate, pop.template,
   fill.template, aux.estimates (read carefully the related help pages:
   ?contrasts.RG).
 - Dialog windows calling svystatTM, svystatR, svystatQ, svystatL,
   aux.estimates now generate the "design" attribute of output objects: it
   stores the name of the design input object on which summary statistics have
   been computed.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.1

 - In windows OS, a tcltk2 bug (signalled to the tcltk2 maintainer, but still
   pending) mistakenly changes TkDefaultFont from its tcltk default value. This
   has been fixed in internal function Intro.RG by resetting the original value.
 - Inadvisable (albeit not harmful) code (signalled by Prof Brian Ripley) has
   been eliminated from .onLoad.
 - Few partial arguments matching in function calls (as signalled by R CMD CHECK
   under R 2.15.x) have been removed.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 1.0

 - Stable release, published for general availability in December 2011 on:
   1) Istat official website:
      http://www.istat.it/it/strumenti/metodi-e-software/software/regenesees
   2) JOINUP (The European Commission open source software repository):
      https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/regenesees/description
 - Export to text files now automatically sets col.names=NA whenever the 
   user selects col.names=TRUE and row.names=TRUE simultaneously. This
   is what function write.csv does by default: a blank name is given to
   the rownames column (see ?write.table).


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 0.9.1

 - First external release: available since middle November 2011
   at the OSOR repository (subsequently migrated to JOINUP).
 - Import from text files now has quote="\"" instead of quote="\"'" (which is
   read.table default): this setting avoids problems arising from apostrophe
   marks frequently occurring in romance languages.


Changes in ReGenesees.GUI version 0.9

 - Release-candidate version: it is almost 1.0 complete.
 - It has been published in the Istat intranet on 8/11/2011.
